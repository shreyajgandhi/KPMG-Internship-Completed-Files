# KPMG-Internship-Completed-Files
This repository contains all the files created and used to complete the internship.
I recently participated in KPMG's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on the Data, Analytics & Modelling team at KPMG.
I worked on a project to advise a client on customer targeting and I practicedassessing data quality, garnering insights, and creating dashboards in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working to leverage data to produce better business outcomes and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Data, Analytics & Modelling team at a company like KPMG.
